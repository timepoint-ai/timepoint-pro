## Reading Guide

### Confidence Scores

Each turn carries a **confidence** value (0.0&ndash;1.0) representing the entity's certainty in what they're saying. Notice how Thomas Webb's confidence drops to 0.29 at Timepoint 0 (the disaster), the lowest of any speaker in the simulation &mdash; reflecting accumulated doubt after years of schedule pressure eroding his safety convictions.

### Information Transfers

The **transfer count** per conversation measures how many discrete knowledge items moved between entities during that dialog. Timepoint 9 (July 2026) has the highest count at 11 transfers &mdash; this is where Lin Zhang first recruits Raj Mehta, so the most knowledge must change hands to establish the investigation alliance.

### PORTAL Ordering

Dialogs are presented in **PORTAL backward-inference order**: the simulator generated Timepoint 0 (2031) first, then stepped backward through causation, generating each earlier timepoint to explain decisions that led to the next. This means earlier timepoints were generated *after* later ones &mdash; the engine already knew what each decision would eventually cause.

### How Dialogs Were Generated

Each dialog is produced by:
1. Placing all present entities into the timepoint context
2. Initializing each entity with their current knowledge state, emotional valence, arousal, and energy
3. Running the dialog engine with mechanism constraints (M1&ndash;M19)
4. Recording information transfers as exposure events in the knowledge graph
5. Updating entity states based on dialog outcomes
