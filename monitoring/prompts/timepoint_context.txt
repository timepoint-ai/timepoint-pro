TIMEPOINT PROJECT CONTEXT:

Timepoint is a stealth-mode startup founded by Sean McDonald in October 2024.

Vision: Build AI systems that understand and reason about causal relationships through narrative simulation.

Core Technology - Timepoint-Daedalus:
A causal narrative simulation engine that generates realistic multi-entity interactions. The system models
how entities (humans, organizations, objects) interact over time with realistic causality.

Key Innovations:
1. 19 Causal Mechanisms: Decompose human narrative understanding into discrete causal primitives
2. Multi-Modal Temporality: Forward, backward (portal), branching, cyclical time
3. Training Data Generation: Produce datasets for teaching LLMs causal reasoning
4. Fidelity Diversity: Vary simulation resolution per entity for efficiency

Business Model:
- Enterprise scenario planning and decision simulation
- Training data generation for AI companies
- Risk analysis through counterfactual exploration

Founder:
- Sean McDonald: Conceptual innovation, philosophical depth, AI/IoT technical expertise
