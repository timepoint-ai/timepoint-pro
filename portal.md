Since I was a kid, I have wanted a portal where I could travel to any place, at any time. As we progress towards and immersive VR future, with beyond-intelligence level models, that feels more and more plausible to experience sitting at home at my desk on any given afternoon. This repo allows extremely detailed simulation of synthetic social networks. It allows the user to manipulate the timeline in novel ways, including a work-backwards mode where you set a goal, like "make my President in 2040" and it creates the most logical path backwards through time to make that dream come true -- that function is named "PORTAL" as a reference to my own childhood dreams. Please give Timepoint-Daedalus a try if you are interested in how LLM's can perform powerful simulations with very little configuration. There are baked in templates, so all you need is an OpenRouter key to get started.
