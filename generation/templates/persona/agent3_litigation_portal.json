  "scenario_description": "PORTAL backward reasoning from a devastating $47M trade secret verdict to its origins. A federal jury in the Northern District of California has returned a verdict against former biotech researcher Dr. James Whitfield for misappropriating proprietary CRISPR formulations from NovaBio Labs and delivering them to competitor GeneSys Therapeutics. Working backward from the verdict in March 2026: What chain of hiring failures, inadequate trade secret protections, missed red flags during employment, botched exit interviews, delayed discovery of the theft, litigation strategy missteps, and courtroom errors created this outcome? Four legal actors trace the causal chain backward through 8 steps. Knowledge provenance is critical: at each backward step, who possessed what evidence and when they obtained it determines whether the litigation path was inevitable or avoidable.",

Whitfield, a former senior researcher at NovaBio Labs, transferred proprietary CRISPR gene-editing formulations to competitor GeneSys Therapeutics within weeks of joining them. The verdict includes $12M in actual damages, $23M in unjust enrichment, and $12M in exemplary damages for willful misappropriation. GeneSys is enjoined from using the formulations for 5 years. Trace backward to January 2024 to understand: How did NovaBio fail to protect its trade secrets? Why did Whitfield's departure go unchallenged for 6 months? What discovery failures and litigation strategy errors shaped the trial outcome?",
