  "scenario_description": "Dr. Kate Nez-Bridger (AGENT4) elk migration scenario. CYCLICAL mode simulation of the Northern Yellowstone elk herd over two seasonal cycles (2 years). Four entities interact across the landscape: the herd matriarch (embodying herd decision-making and migration memory), a wolf pack (predation pressure that shifts seasonally), a district ranger (management decisions and human-elk conflict), and a university biologist (monitoring and adaptive management recommendations). The simulation tracks two full annual cycles: spring migration, summer range, fall rut and hunting season, winter range and mortality. Climate pressure manifests as reduced snowpack affecting spring green-up timing, which cascades through forage availability, calf survival, migration timing, and human-elk conflict at ranch boundaries. Quantitative state includes herd count by age/sex class, vegetation biomass, snow depth, and predation rate.",
