  "scenario_description": "Victoria Langford-Chen (AGENT1) regulatory stress test scenario. PORTAL backward reasoning from an adverse portfolio outcome to root causes. A major asset management firm faces a 40% drawdown in its commercial real estate portfolio during a rapid rate tightening cycle. Working backward from the adverse outcome: the Chief Risk Officer discovers the exposure was concentrated in floating-rate instruments, the CFO finds the hedge was inadequate, the regulator identifies gaps in stress testing methodology, and the analyst traces the original position sizing to a flawed correlation assumption. Portal mode reconstructs the causal chain from the macro shock through market mechanisms to the specific portfolio impact, producing the kind of audit trail that OCC examiners demand.",

The OCC examination reveals inadequate stress testing methodology, concentrated floating-rate exposure, and a hedge that was sized using a flawed correlation assumption from 18 months prior. Trace backward from the portfolio loss through the decision chain: who approved the position sizing, when was the correlation assumption last validated, why did the hedge committee approve an inadequate hedge, and what information did the risk officer have when she signed off on the quarterly stress test.",
