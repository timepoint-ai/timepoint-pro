  "scenario_description": "The research vessel Meridian crash-lands on Kepler-442b after a navigation system failure during orbital insertion. Six crew members survive with partial supplies, a damaged ship, and no way to contact Earth for 14 months. Over 21 days tracked across 10 timepoints, they must decide: fortify the crash site, explore the alien biosphere, or attempt to repair the ship's emergency beacon. The planet is alive. Bioluminescent flora responds to electromagnetic signatures from the crew's equipment. A migratory fauna pattern the crew doesn't yet understand predicts violent weather cycles that follow no Earth logic. Knowledge provenance is survival: who discovered the water source is contaminated? Who noticed the fauna migration pattern predicts storms? Who found the cave system that could shelter them — or trap them? Commander Tanaka carries guilt for the crash. Dr. Okonkwo is fascinated by the xenobiology but starts as a background presence until his expertise becomes critical. Engineer Sharma is the only one who can assess ship repairs. Lt. Cole advocates a fortress strategy. Atmospheric scientist Vasquez tracks alien weather patterns. Navigator Park, injured in the crash with limited mobility, holds pre-crash navigation data that could explain why they landed on the wrong hemisphere. The crashed Meridian itself is a depleting resource — life support draining, hull integrity degrading. Crew morale propagates through the group as an emergent force. On Day 7, Commander Tanaka must choose: Branch A (Fortify & Wait) consolidates at the crash site, repairing life support and rationing supplies — conservative but depletes reserves. Branch B (Explore & Adapt) sends teams into the alien biosphere to discover food sources, map cave systems, and learn fauna patterns — higher risk but builds knowledge. Branch C (Repair & Signal) commits all resources to repairing the emergency beacon — fastest path to rescue if successful, catastrophic if it fails. Each branch is evaluated against quantitative resource constraints: O2 reserves, food rations in kg, water purification rate, hull integrity percentage, ambient radiation levels, and fauna migration indices. The alien biosphere has its own agency through bioluminescent response patterns, and the local fauna follows migratory instincts that the crew can learn to read. This scenario exercises all 19 mechanisms including heterogeneous fidelity (M1: ship at TENSOR, commander at TRAINED, injured navigator at SCENE), progressive training (M2: Dr. Okonkwo elevates from SCENE to TRAINED as xenobiology queries accumulate), physics validation (M4: O2 consumption rate x crew count = depletion timeline), lazy resolution (M5: navigator elevated on query about pre-crash data), tensor compression (M6: biosphere as TTM tensor), on-demand entities (M9: cargo bay inventory and lower deck survivors generated on query), and model selection (M18: specialized models for math, dialog, structured JSON, and branch evaluation).",
