  "scenario_description": "Three-day pitch roadshow across California. Monday in Los Angeles: founders meet Alex Martinez at Maverick Ventures (entertainment tech focused). Founder A emphasizes Company's content generation capabilities: 'Game studios spend $2M on dialog trees. We generate branching narratives with modal causality for $100K.' Alex is intrigued by the animistic entities (M16) for NPC AI in games. \n\nWednesday in San Francisco: first meeting with Jennifer Park at Sequoia (enterprise AI focused). Founder B leads: 'Enterprises need synthetic training data for proprietary LLMs. We enable vertical fine-tuning datasets at 95% cost reduction.' Jennifer asks about SOC2, enterprise SLAs, and sales cycle. Founder A explains ANDOS layer-by-layer training for deterministic outputs enterprises require. \n\nThursday in San Francisco: meeting with David Chen at a16z (developer tools focused). Technical deep-dive: Founder A walks through the 17 mechanisms, query engine, fault tolerance. David gets excited about the developer experience: 'This is Terraform for simulation.' Founders realize they found the right positioning. \n\nTrack 7 timepoints: (1) LA pitch with Alex, (2) Travel to SF / debrief, (3) Sequoia pitch with Jennifer, (4) Post-meeting founder discussion on positioning, (5) a16z pitch with David, (6) Founder synthesis: which narrative resonated?, (7) Follow-up strategy. Demonstrates M3 (knowledge accumulation: each meeting informs the next), M13 (multi-entity synthesis: three VCs with different thesis lenses), M10 (scene atmospheres: LA creative vs SF analytical), M7 (causal chains: positioning evolution across meetings).",
