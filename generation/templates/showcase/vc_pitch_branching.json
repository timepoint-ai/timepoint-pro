  "scenario_description": "High-stakes pitch meeting at tier-1 VC. Founder A and Founder B have 45 minutes to convince Jennifer Park (Partner) and David Kim (Associate) to invest $2M in Company. The pitch goes well until minute 30, when Jennifer leans forward and asks the critical question: 'Your tech is impressive, but I need to see traction. What's your MRR?' \n\nThis is the branching point. The timeline splits into 4 distinct futures: \n\n**Branch A (Strong Traction)**: Founder A confidently answers '$50K MRR across 5 enterprise customers, 300% month-over-month growth.' Jennifer's eyes light up. She asks about unit economics, customer concentration, retention. Founder A has the data. David pulls up the model: 'If they maintain this growth, they hit $1M ARR in 6 months.' Jennifer offers a term sheet on the spot: $2M at $15M post. They close in 2 weeks. \n\n**Branch B (Weak Traction)**: Founder A hesitates. 'We're pre-revenue, focused on product-market fit.' Jennifer's body language shifts. 'So no paying customers?' Founder B tries to recover: 'We have 20 beta users giving feedback.' Jennifer: 'Call us when you have $10K MRR. Too early for us.' The meeting ends cordially but the deal is dead. They leave with polite rejection. \n\n**Branch C (Honest Pivot)**: Founder A takes a breath. 'We have 3 pilots generating qualitative feedback but no revenue yet. However, what we learned is fascinating...' She pivots to the design partner insights: game studios want NPC AI, VR companies want scenario generation. Jennifer appreciates the honesty and strategic thinking. 'This sounds more like a developer platform than vertical SaaS. Have you considered positioning as Stripe for simulations?' This opens a new strategic conversation. Jennifer offers $1.5M at $10M post with milestone-based second tranche. They negotiate for 3 weeks. \n\n**Branch D (Competitive FOMO)**: As Founder A starts to answer, David's phone buzzes. He glances down, then whispers to Jennifer. She reads: 'Competitor just raised $10M Series A from Sequoia for similar simulation tech.' Jennifer's entire demeanor changes. Suddenly the question isn't 'Should we invest?' but 'How do we move fast enough to win this deal?' She offers $2.5M at $15M post, 'take it or leave it in 48 hours.' The founders feel the power dynamic invert. \n\nTrack 12 timepoints: 3 before critical question + 1 branching moment + 8 after (2 per branch). Demonstrates M12 (counterfactual branching: 4 distinct futures from one decision), M15 (prospection: both sides modeling outcomes), M8 (embodied stress: Founder A's heart rate, Founder B's sweating affecting pitch performance), M17 (BRANCHING mode causality), M11 (dialog variations across branches).",
