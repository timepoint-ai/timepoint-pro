  "scenario_description": "SEC enforcement investigation into insider trading at a mid-cap pharmaceutical company. A junior analyst tipped the SEC that executives traded ahead of a failed FDA trial. Four entities navigate the investigation with structurally enforced information barriers: the SEC enforcement attorney builds a case through formal channels only (subpoenas, depositions, trading records); the company general counsel faces conflicting duties to the board and implicated executives; the whistleblower holds direct knowledge but fears retaliation; and outside defense counsel represents the implicated VP with privileged communications the SEC cannot access. Knowledge provenance tracks exactly who knew about material non-public information (the Phase III trial failure) and when, which is the legal definition of insider trading liability.",
