  "scenario_description": "Parallel timelines exploring pitch strategy selection. In each timeline, Founder A (CEO) and Founder B (COO) pitch Company to Jennifer Park (VC Partner) and David Kim (Associate), but their strategic framing varies dramatically: \n\n**Timeline A (Technical Pitch)**: Founder A leads with the architecture. 'We've solved a fundamental problem in AI: tensor compression for temporal knowledge graphs. Our TTM mechanism achieves 97% compression ratio\u201450,000 tokens down to 200\u2014while preserving queryability. No one else has modal causality with BRANCHING and CYCLICAL modes.' She walks through the 17 mechanisms, ANDOS layer-by-layer training, fault tolerance architecture. David (technical associate) is impressed: 'This is legitimate research.' But Jennifer pushes back: 'I invest in businesses, not papers. Who pays for this?' The pitch feels academic. Jennifer is skeptical about commercial viability. \n\n**Timeline B (Business Pitch)**: Founder B leads with market size. 'AI training data is a $25B market growing 40% annually. Our customers\u2014game studios, VR companies, edtech\u2014spend $2M on content generation. We deliver the same outcome for $100K. That's 95% cost reduction with 20x margin. Unit economics: $5K ACV, $250 COGS, 24-month payback. We're targeting $10M ARR in 18 months.' He shows the Excel model. Jennifer loves the numbers: 'Now we're talking. What's your GTM motion?' They spend 30 minutes on sales strategy. Jennifer is excited about the business model but wants to see traction first. \n\n**Timeline C (Vision Pitch)**: Founder A paints the future. 'Every company will need temporal AI. Today, LLMs are stateless\u2014they don't understand causality, time, or consequences. We're creating a new category: Temporal AI Infrastructure. Think of us as Snowflake for simulation, or Databricks for causal reasoning. In 5 years, every enterprise will run temporal simulations for planning, training, compliance. We're not just a tool; we're the foundation layer for the next generation of AI that understands *when* things happen and *why*.' Jennifer leans in: 'That's a generational bet. Do you have the team to build category-defining infrastructure?' The pitch becomes about founder ambition and vision scale. \n\nTrack 9 timepoints: 2 before pitch start + 1 pitch beginning + 6 divergent (2 per timeline). Demonstrates M12 (alternate histories: same meeting, different strategies), M10 (scene atmosphere analysis: technical vs business vs visionary mood), M15 (VC prospection: Jennifer evaluates founder judgment through strategy choice), M17 (directorial mode for dramatic comparison of outcomes).",
