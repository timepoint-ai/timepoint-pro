# Timepoint v0 (Daedalus)
## PRE RELEASE 
### A.K.A. Built and tested entirely by one person and his AIs. 

**Temporal simulation where detail follows attention, not allocation. Heading towards queryable temporal knowledge graphs of complex, large-scale social network simulations.**

## tl;dr 
Timepoint is a tool to use LLMs to render accurate past and future moments. When you render any Timepoint it produces a variable fidelity social graph, detailed character bios and allows you to steer deterministic and stochastic components of social network simulations. The most interesting part to people who have seen pre-release demos, like the talk I did at AI Tinkerers LA on Nov 20, 2025, is PORTAL mode. Timepoint Daedalus can "portal" to a future timepoint and make logical, judged steps "backwards" from that timepoint to current time, path seeking through simulated reality. This appears highly valuable to people who manage capital. 

(See MECHANICS.md for details.)

Editorial note, written entirely by a human, x.com/seanmcdonaldxyz: 

This is both a context engineering and artistic steering tool, designed and built by one person, with choices representing both technical requirements and artistic experience testing the tool and attempting to utilize the results in my own life. My goal is to make "synthetic time travel" kind of like the movies of my childhood. One day soon I will be able to put on a VR headset and use Timepoint to zap to any moment past or present with high fidelity. As a technology, for now, my inspiration is to make something close to a modular synthesizer, or a sequencer...like a drum machine. Something tooled to how I envision simulating social networks, as much as an artist or storyteller as engineer or data wrangler. 

At scale, this tooling allows for synthetic data generation in important, novel structures and formats. It's also designed to support artistic expression. Ideally a screenwriter will be able to utilize Timepoint with the same sophistication as the best engineer. Our coding agents will be able to operate Timepoint on our behalf, making that possible much sooner than would otherwise be possible. Simulation can be immensely valuable for work in capital markets, but it's also fun, interesting, and valuable for personal coaching and self-improvement.

## Intro:

Timepoint-Daedalus is a v0 Pre-Release of a temporal simulation framework where detail follows queries, not pre-allocation. Instead of rendering every entity at every moment at full fidelity (expensive, wasteful), the system maintains a 2D resolution surface over (entity, time) that concentrates detail where you actually look. Minor characters exist as 200-token tensor embeddings until someone asks about them—then they're elevated while preserving causal consistency with everything already established.
The result: in theory, up to a 95% cost reduction without breaking temporal reasoning. You can still ask "what did Jefferson know when he wrote this?" because knowledge provenance is tracked explicitly, not summarized away.
Bonus weirdness: multiple temporal modes (including backward reasoning from known endpoints), entities that model their own futures, and objects/institutions with animistic agency.
Timepoint embraces curiosity, by enabling a set of modular tools for configuring temporal simulations. 

This version is named after Daedalus, the legendary inventor, one who could navigate the labyrinth. But Daedalus also gave a stern warning: don't put too much faith in technology. Social network simulations are not real life -- they're a tool for preparing for the future. And maybe, for predicting it. 🤔

## A Major Problem with Simulation: Token Growth with Time Steps of Social Networks Leads to Context Collapse 

Traditional LLM-based simulations treat fidelity as uniform: every entity, every moment, rendered at the same resolution. This is expensive and wasteful. Most of that detail is never queried again. 
Worse, compression-based solutions degrade temporal structure. You can't reason about causality in a lossy summary and you can't maintain coherence in ever-growing context windows. 

## A new approach based on mixed resolution mapping

Timepoint-Daedalus inverts the model: **resolution is query-driven, not pre-allocated.** The system maintains a 2D fidelity surface across entities and time, concentrating detail where queries actually land—like a map that renders at higher resolution only where you zoom.

This isn't caching. It's a fundamentally different stance on what simulation *is*: not a pre-rendered world, but a generative process that resolves on demand while preserving causal structure. 

A key component is tensor-like objects for behaviors and personalities.

## Core Ideas

### Heterogeneous Fidelity as First-Class Concept

Each (entity, timepoint) pair maintains independent resolution: `TENSOR_ONLY → SCENE → GRAPH → DIALOG → TRAINED`. A minor attendee at the Constitutional Convention exists as a 200-token tensor embedding until someone asks about them—then the system elevates their resolution, synthesizes their perspective, and preserves causal consistency with what's already established.

Result: 95% token reduction without temporal incoherence.

### Multiple Temporal Ontologies
## A.K.A. Having Fun Bending Time

Time isn't one thing. The system supports distinct temporal modes drawn from narrative theory and causal inference:

- **Pearl**: Standard causal DAG—causes precede effects
- **Portal**: Backward reasoning from known outcomes to plausible causes (how did we get to a $1.2B valuation?)
- **Directorial**: Narrative time with flashbacks, foreshadowing, ellipsis
- **Branching**: Counterfactual timelines that diverge from decision points
- **Cyclical**: Prophetic/mythic time where future states constrain past events

Each mode changes what "temporal consistency" means and how the causal validators operate.

Like knobs on a synthesizer, you can tune how Timepoint handles synthetic tie.

### Knowledge Provenance via Exposure Events

Entities don't magically know things. The system tracks *exposure events*: who learned what, from whom, when. This enables:

- Preventing anachronistic knowledge ("How does Jefferson know about the Louisiana Purchase in 1787?")
- Tracing belief formation and information flow
- Answering counterfactuals ("If Madison hadn't shared his notes, what would Hamilton believe?")

### Animistic Agency and Entity Prospection

Two deliberately human extensions:

**M15 (Prospection)**: Entities model their own futures, with those models influencing present behavior. A founder considering a pivot doesn't just react to current state—they simulate consequences and act on those simulations.

**M16 (Animistic Agency)**: Objects, institutions, and places can have agency. The conference room "wants" productive meetings; the startup's codebase "resists" certain architectural changes. This captures how non-human entities shape behavior without requiring explicit rules.

---

## What This Enables

**Natural language to queryable simulation:**
```
"Simulate the founding team's first board meeting after 
learning a competitor raised $50M. Focus on how information 
flows between the CEO and CTO, and what each believes the 
other is thinking."
```

The system generates entities at appropriate resolution, simulates the scenario with causal consistency, and allows follow-up queries that elevate specific entities or moments as needed.

**Temporal queries across fidelity levels:**
- "What did the CTO know at 2pm that she didn't know at 10am?"
- "Trace how the competitor news changed the CEO's position on the pivot"
- "Branch: what if the CTO had learned the news first?"

**Fine-tuning data generation:**
- Horizontal: many scenario variations for training breadth
- Vertical: deep temporal simulations for training causal reasoning

## Architecture (Brief)

The 19 mechanisms in MECHANICS.md implement these ideas:

| Concept | Mechanisms |
|---------|------------|
| Heterogeneous fidelity | M1 (fidelity graphs), M2 (progressive training), M5 (lazy elevation), M6 (tensor compression) |
| Temporal reasoning | M7 (causal chains), M8 (vertical expansion), M12 (counterfactual branching) |
| Knowledge tracking | M3 (graph construction), M4 (embedding), M9 (on-demand generation), **M19 (knowledge extraction)** |
| Synthesis | M10 (scene management), M11 (dialog), M13 (multi-entity), M15 (prospection), M16 (animistic agency) |
| Infrastructure | M14 (circadian patterns), M17 (metadata tracking), **M18 (model selection)** |
| Evaluation | **Convergence analysis** (causal graph consistency across runs) |

See [MECHANICS.md](MECHANICS.md) for implementation details.

## Intelligent Model Selection (M18)

Timepoint-Daedalus includes a capability-based model selection system that automatically chooses the optimal LLM for each action type. This enables:

- **Action-appropriate models**: Math-heavy reasoning uses DeepSeek-R1; dialog synthesis uses Llama 3.1 70B
- **Cost optimization**: Fast/cheap models for simple tasks, expensive models only when needed
- **Automatic fallbacks**: If a model fails, the system retries with alternatives
- **License compliance**: Only open-source models that permit commercial synthetic data generation

### Supported Models (via OpenRouter)

| Model | Strengths | License |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Llama 3.1 (8B/70B/405B) | Dialog, general reasoning | Llama 3.1 |
| Llama 4 Scout | Multimodal, balanced | Llama 4 |
| Qwen 2.5 (7B/72B) | Structured JSON, code | Qwen |
| QwQ 32B | Mathematical reasoning | Qwen |
| DeepSeek Chat/R1 | Deep reasoning, math | **MIT** |
| Mistral/Mixtral | Fast inference, cost-efficient | **Apache 2.0** |

### Usage

```python
from llm_service import LLMService, ActionType

service = LLMService(config)

# Automatic model selection based on action type
response = service.call_with_action(
    action=ActionType.DIALOG_SYNTHESIS,
    system="You are a dialog generator",
    user="Generate a conversation between two founders"
)

# Override with preferences
response = service.call_with_action(
    action=ActionType.TEMPORAL_REASONING,
    system="You are a causal analyst",
    user="What events led to this outcome?",
    prefer_quality=True  # Selects highest-quality model for the task
)

# Structured output with action-appropriate model
from pydantic import BaseModel

class EntityProfile(BaseModel):
    name: str
    traits: dict
    knowledge: list[str]

entity = service.structured_call_with_action(
    action=ActionType.ENTITY_POPULATION,
    system="Generate entity profiles",
    user="Create a profile for a skeptical board member",
    schema=EntityProfile
)
```

## Performance

| Scenario | Naive Cost | Timepoint-Daedalus | Reduction |
|----------|------------|---------------------|-----------|
| 5 entities, 3 timepoints | ~$1.00 | $0.02-0.05 | 95-98% |
| 10 entities, 5 timepoints | ~$3.00 | $0.08-0.15 | 95-97% |
| 20 entities, 10 timepoints | ~$10.00 | $0.30-0.60 | 94-97% |

*Updated January 2026 based on actual run costs with Llama 4 Scout via OpenRouter.*

Cost reduction comes from query-driven fidelity, not lossy compression—temporal consistency is preserved.

## When to Use This

**Good fit:**
- Exploring "how might we get from here to there" scenarios (PORTAL mode)
- Simulations requiring causal consistency and knowledge provenance
- Training data generation for temporal/causal reasoning
- Scenarios where you'll query specific entities/moments deeply

**Not the right tool (yet):**
- Production systems requiring SLAs (research prototype)
- Real-time applications (LLM latency dominates)
- Enterprise-scale (1000+ concurrent runs) - needs distributed infrastructure

---

## The Vision

Timepoint today is a **simulation engine** with a **complete REST API**. The roadmap leads toward a **simulation infrastructure platform**:

**Near-term (Q1-Q2 2026):**
- ~~REST API for programmatic access~~ **COMPLETE** (Dec 2025)
- ~~Batch execution with parallel workers~~ **COMPLETE** (Dec 2025)
- PostgreSQL for production persistence
- Containerized deployment (Docker, Kubernetes)

**Medium-term (Q3-Q4 2026):**
- External integrations (prediction markets, decision systems)
- Advanced dashboard (timeline visualization, entity graphs)
- Distributed execution at scale (1000+ workers)

**Long-term (2027+):**
- Consumer experiences ("synthetic time travel")
- Platform ecosystem (plugins, vertical solutions)
- Immersive interfaces (VR/AR exploration)

See [MILESTONES.md](MILESTONES.md) for the detailed roadmap.

#### *Footnote: Why 'Daedalus'?*

Daedalus mastered the labyrinth, but offered a strong warning: trust this technology too much and it will be dangerous. Just as if you do not use it enough. Be like Daedalus; not like Icarus. Social network simulation is powerful, but not reality, and never will be.
