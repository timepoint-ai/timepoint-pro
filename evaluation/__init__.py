# evaluation/__init__.py - Causal graph convergence evaluation
"""
Evaluation module for measuring causal graph convergence across simulation runs.

This module provides tools for:
- Extracting causal graphs from simulation runs
- Computing similarity between causal graphs
- Measuring convergence across multiple runs of the same scenario
- Identifying divergence points in causal chains

The key insight: Timepoint predicts causal mechanisms, not just outcomes.
Convergence across independent runs indicates robust causal chains.
